Ryobi ONE+ Wall-Mount Battery Holder by otisinc on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1626634

Summary:
Owning a number of Ryobi ONE+ tools and batteries, and being disappointed at the available options for storing our extra batteries, we came up with this design.Holds all flavors of 18V ONE+ battery.Mounts on the wall with standard drywall screws.Prints easily in PLA, ABS and PETG.Requires almost no finishing work after printing.For best results, support material should be used on the area where the battery clips mate with the holder (see photos).We used honeycomb infill at about 30-40% to make sure the part would be very sturdy and feel strong and heavy, and because these are the settings that help us minimize shrinkage cracking with our plastic and printer, but the design should hold up even with minimal infill (15-20%).The model shown was printed in red ASA (similar to ABS) and finished by hand with acetone and 400-through-1000 grit sandpaper.  This is not necessary to make the part functional, we just wanted it to look pretty.
